# Belly Button Bacteria Culture Diversity
The main purpose of this project was to create a website that shows belly button diversity data fopr each subject that was involved in a study looking for bacteria that cen be used to make synthetic meat. The data that is shown on the website changes depending on what subject ID the user chooses from the drop down menu. The website features a information panel that displays the chosen subject's metadata, a bar chart showing top 10 bacteria cultures found in the subject's belly button, a gauge chart showing belly button washing frequency, and a bubble chart showing the number of bacteria varieties of each bacteria type that were found in the chosen subject's belly button.
